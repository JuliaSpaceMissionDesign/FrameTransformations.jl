Computable axes are the equivalent of SPICE's parameterized two-vector frames. \n\nThese axes are built such that the first vector, known as the primary vector, is parallel to  one axis of the frame; the component of the secondary vector orthogonal to the first is parallel to another axis of the frame, and the cross product of the two vectors is parallel to the  remaining axis. \n\nThe primary and secondary vectors, v1 and v2 are instances of ComputableAxesVector,  which is used to define the NAIF IDs of the vector origin and target, and its order.

However, in practice, it is usually more convenient to use Terrestrial Time (TT) as it makes  no significant differences (< 0.01 μas) in the final result.\nFor the IAU 2006A model, the function strictly follows the SOFA implementation. It first  computes the IAU 2000A nutation, then applies adjustments for the consequences of the change  in obliquity from the IAU 1980 ecliptic to the IAU 2006 ecliptic and (ii) for the secular  variation in the Earth's dynamical form factor J2. These corrections ensure that the IAU  2000A nutation is consistent with the IAU 2006 precession model. Please note that the  coefficients available on the IERS tables already include those corrections, and are  retrieved by multiplying the amplitudes of the SOFA nutation in longitude coefficients by  1.00000047. \nThe computation of the free-core nutation and time dependent effects are excluded from this  model. To achieve the < 1μas accuracy with the IAU 2006/2000 A precession-nutation models,  such effects must be included a-posteriori (through dX and dY) using the IERS EOP data.\nFor the IAU 2000B model, the nutation series is truncated from nearly 1400 terms to only 77,  yet it still delivers results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs. In particular, it delivers  a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100 (only very occasionally just outside 1 mas).  The coefficients are taken from SOFA's implementation, which slighlty differ from those  reported in McCarthy and Luzum (2003). Comparisons with IAU 2006A show that the SOFA version  between 1995 and 2050 delivers 0.283 mas RMSE (0.994 mas in the worst case), whereas the  IERS Conventions website version delivers 0.312 RMSE (1.125 mas in the worst case).\nThe IAU 2000B model includes constant planetary bias terms that compensate for long-period  nutations. These amplitudes used in this implementation are optimised for a rigorous method,  where frame bias, precession and nutation are applied separately and in that order  (see SOFA's documentation for further insights).\nA simplified version of the Fundamental Arguments, taken from Simon et al (1994) is exploited  for IAU2000B as the error introduced is below the model accuracy ( ~0.1 mas).\n\nReferences\n\nLuzum, B. and Petit G.
